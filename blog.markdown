I'd most like to engage people in. Specifically, it is about **currencies as 
social DNA**.

You see, corporations, institutions, governments, and nations are **in fact** 
living organisms. This is not a lofty metaphor, but literal truth.

They have a survival instinct to self-perpetuate, they breed new corporations 
and institutions, and even as the cells within them are replaced, their fundamental 
pattern continues. And we are their cells.

Our commercial economy is headed for destruction. There are many contributing 
factors, but in the end it all boils down to the fact that we’ve broken the 
core covenants, contracts or agreements of successful economies. These rules 
exist for a reason and you can no more avoid them than you can the principles 
of mathematics or the laws of physics.

The commercial economy is completely dependent upon the two layers of underlying 
economies that it is built on. First, there is the social economy inside of 
which we raise our children, have real relationships and take care of each 
other. For example, we don’t pay parents to make babies, teach language, potty-train, 
or devote a couple decades of care and support. Parents “manufacture” the entire 
labor force for the market economy. They provide talented employees in a much 
more real way than head-hunting firms, yet earn no commissions for their years 
of work.

A lot of people seem to struggle with the concept of gift economies. Over the recent few hundred years, we have gotten so acculturated to market economies that we tend to project tit-for-tat exchange onto every interaction and into every motivation. However, I believe this is erroneous. My goal in this blog entry is to remind us of our deep familiarity with gift economies and to provide a clear contrast between them and market economies.  
 

Money Can't Buy You Love...or Trust.    [Reposted from [New Currency Frontiers][1]]  
  
  
 Let's lay this out on the table as simply and clearly as possible (continuing Alan's theme about Quid Pro Quo).  
 That's not how I interact with my closest family and friends. We share things freely. You don't need to pay me for meals or for using my car, my camper or my bike. We don't really keep track of things like who bought the movie tickets or paid more than their share at the restaurant.  
  
 Of course, we don't have to keep track of those things because we trust each other. We know that we all chip in to take care of each other. This is the way clans and tribes have worked for millions of years of human history. We're deeply steeped in this type of sharing and it comes completely naturally to us.  

On the Complementary Currency Skype channel we've got going, there was brief but old standard debate going on about fiat vs. mutual credit currencies.  
  
I chimed in with:

 I wrote these responses in the comments thread on this article about [The End of Social Movements][3]. There are some currency issues in them that I want to capture for later deeper discussion, so I'm reposting here so I'll know where to find them.

  
_**Money and Power Pathologies**_  
  
 Will – I think you make a good point that they’re ability to fool us, does not make them the same thing in essence. And I even like your lunch money metaphor.  
  
 So consider this: We start making alternative lunch money. It is only accepted at our own food carts, and participation is completely voluntary. The corporate thieves/bullies/thugs/raiders can only use it for lunch in that community and there’s only so much lunch they can eat.  
  
 However, if they can’t use it to buy up real estate, bribe politicians, make speculative investments, build their empire of power an anonymity, then it isn’t worth their time and energy to steal.

 Alan’s last couple of posts have attempted to address confusion Openness and what we mean when we talk about that with respect to currencies or the new economy. Responses from various folks indicate that more clarification would be useful.

I originally posted this to the Complementary Currencies discussion group on 
Skype in response to a question from Christoph Hensch. But it probably merits 
inclusion here.

Christoph, I believe we are in the lazy habit of thinking that the flow of 
the currency itself is the one that matters instead of the actual flow of goods, 
services, resources, knowledge or participation which flows COUNTER to an exchange 
currency.

Those real-world currents shaped and enabled by currencies are what make them 
so valuable and powerful.

I just posted a reply to a post about currencies as the DNA of social organisms 
on [New Currency Frontiers Blog][1] and wanted to cross-post it here.

Many people seem to struggle with the "social organism" metaphor. I think that 
might be a function of two things: 1) loose boundaries which make it difficult 
to see social level organisms in the usual way we see "things" and 2) wanting 
to be individually more important than we are.
